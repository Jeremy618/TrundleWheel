It also contains a Jupyter notebook file to estimate a distance with all the datas from the phone. It's organized like this:
1.Convert data from the raw txt file into a table in a CSV file
2.Plot final report, graphs and trajectory on a map
3.Correlation between datas
4.Condition Datas in order to apply convolutional neural networks on them
5.Write one big csv data file with all the data file
6.Apply Convolutional neural network on datas
